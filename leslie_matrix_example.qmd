## Leslie Matrix Example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}
# to create a matrix 
#first make a vector 
#then wrap into matrix 
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), 
                        nrow = 3,
                        ncol = 3,
                        byrow = TRUE)
insect_leslie
```

```{r}
# Initial Condition
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```

```{r}
# Multiplying initial condition times matrix 
#Estimated population at year 
#hence year 2 initial condition 
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0
insect_y1
```

Estimate population at each life stage at year 2 and year 3 
```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
insect_y2

insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2
insect_y3
```
